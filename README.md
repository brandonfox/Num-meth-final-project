# Numerical Method Final Project

We created an algorithm to differentiate piano noise and violin noise. Samples used in this project are based on instrumental samples downloaded from the University of Iowa. To keep things consistent I will be using only fortissimo samples as the newer violin samples are all ff file extension.

## Getting Started

Calcutions and visualization are in `Num meth final project.ipynb` notebook.

### Prerequisites

Things you need to install are shown in the second cell of the notebook.

```python
!pip install --upgrade pip
!pip install librosa
```

### Installing

It is recommended that you restart your kernal and rerun all of the cell.
